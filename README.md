# sentimentAnalysisFinal

#The program uses the streamlit library for GUI
#run streamlit final.py on your terminal once you download the code
#The dataset used is also provided in the folder
#changing the dataset will require that you also update the code so that pandas locates the correct columns, this is as simple as setting the column name to the new column name in the new dataset
#enjoy our work and modify as you please to suit your needs
